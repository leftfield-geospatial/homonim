Regression modelling
====================

``homonim`` can improve the consistency and accuracy of quantitative remote sensing applications such as regression modelling.  This case study gives a simple demonstration of how surface reflectance correction improves the information content of image features in a biomass (aboveground carbon) mapping application.

A small mosaic of 4 `NGI <https://ngi.dalrrd.gov.za/index.php/what-we-do/aerial-photography-and-imagery>`_ aerial images and aboveground carbon (AGC) ground truth data are used for the investigation.

The data and results in this case study are taken from the `regression modelling tutorial <../tutorials/regression_modelling.ipynb>`_.
