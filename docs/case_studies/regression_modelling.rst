Regression modelling
====================

``homonim`` can improve accuracy and consistency in quantitative remote sensing applications.  This case study demonstrates the use of ``homonim`` to improve the relevance of image features for modelling aboveground carbon (AGC).  The images and ground truth data are taken from an `AGC mapping study <https://github.com/dugalh/map_thicket_agc>`_.

A small mosaic of 4 `NGI <https://ngi.dalrrd.gov.za/index.php/what-we-do/aerial-photography-and-imagery>`_ aerial images covering the study site were corrected to surface reflectance with ``homonim``.  Correction was performed with the *gain-blk-offset* model, a kernel shape of 15x15 pixels, and a Sentinel-2 reference image.  AGC ground truth data for 85 plots are overlaid on the corrected mosaic below.

For this problem, `NDVI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index>`_ is reasonably good predictor of AGC.  The next figure shows the correlation of NDVI and AGC in each ground truth plot, before and after correction to surface reflectance.

The comparison gives an indication of the improvement in the predictive power the imagery.  Even though source image variations due to BRDF and atmospheric effects are small, correction to surface reflectance produces a useful improvement in the NDVI - AGC correlation.  This simple demonstration shows that ``homonim`` can help as a pre-processing step in regression modelling and related applications.
