Correct aerial and satellite imagery to surface reflectance.

.. short_descr_end

.. description_start

Description
-----------

``homonim`` provides a command line interface and API for correcting remotely sensed imagery to approximate surface
reflectance.  It is a form of *spectral harmonisation*, that adjusts for spatially varying atmospheric and anisotropic
(BRDF) effects, by fusion with satellite surface reflectance data.  Manual reflectance measurements and target
placements are not required.

It is useful as a pre-processing step for quantitative mapping applications such as biomass estimation or
precision agriculture, and for reducing seamlines and other visual artefacts in image mosaics.  It can be applied to
multi-spectral drone, aerial and satellite imagery.

``homonim`` is based on the method described in the paper:
`Radiometric homogenisation of aerial images by calibrating with satellite data <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328317307_Radiometric_homogenisation_of_aerial_images_by_calibrating_with_satellite_data>`__.

See the documentation site for more detail: https://homonim.readthedocs.io/.

.. install_start

Installation
------------

``homonim`` is available as a python 3 package, via ``pip`` and ``conda``.

conda
~~~~~

Under Windows, using ``conda`` is the easiest way to resolve binary dependencies. The
`Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__ installation provides a minimal ``conda``.

.. code:: shell

   conda install -c conda-forge homonim

pip
~~~

.. code:: shell

   pip install homonim

.. install_end

Quick Start
-----------

Download the ``homonim`` github repository to get the test imagery. If you have ``git``, you can clone it with:

.. code:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/dugalh/homonim.git

Alternatively, download it from `here <https://github.com/dugalh/homonim/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>`__, extract the
zip archive and rename the *homonim-main* directory to *homonim*.

Using the ``gain-blk-offset`` model and a 5 x 5 pixel kernel, correct the aerial images with the Sentinel-2
reference.

.. code:: shell

   homonim fuse -m gain-blk-offset -k 5 5 -od . ./homonim/tests/data/source/*_RGB.tif ./homonim/tests/data/reference/COPERNICUS-S2-20151003T075826_20151003T082014_T35HKC_B432_Byte.tif

Statistically compare the raw and corrected aerial images with the included Landsat-8 reference.

.. code:: shell

   homonim compare ./homonim/tests/data/source/*_RGB.tif ./*FUSE*.tif ./homonim/tests/data/reference/LANDSAT-LC08-C02-T1_L2-LC08_171083_20150923_B432_Byte.tif

.. example_start

Example
-------

Mosaics of 0.5 m resolution aerial imagery before and after correction with ``homonim``. Correction was performed using the *gain-blk-offset* model and a 5 x 5 pixel kernel, with a Landsat-7 reference image.

Usage
-----

See the documentation `here <https://homonim.readthedocs.io/>`__.

Terminology
-----------

``homonim`` is shorthand for *homogenise image* and is a reference to `the paper <https://www.researchgate
.net/publication/328317307_Radiometric_homogenisation_of_aerial_images_by_calibrating_with_satellite_data>`_ on which
it is based.
